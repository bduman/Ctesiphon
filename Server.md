- [Introduction]

Ever since i started playing online games in middle-school back in 2003 (Warcraft 3) , i have been using messaging applications in order to communicate with my peers. My first such application  which in time became synonimous with was Skype.

Over the yearsI have come to love it since it would enable me and  my friends to  send messages, record audio and also share screens thus providing us a unique experience during long sessions of gaming.

Besides gaming ,we were also using it  for sharing school material(s) , homework discussions and why not school gossip :D

From then on i started to get a real fascination regarding chat apps and all the features that provided
