## Motivation

Ever since i started playing online games in middle-school back in 2003 (Warcraft 3) , i have been using messaging applications in order to communicate with my peers. The first such application  which in time became ubiquitous was Skype.

I have come to love it since it would enable me and  my friends to:

* send messages
* record audio

* share screen

thus , providing us a unique experience during long sessions of gaming.

Besides gaming ,we were also using it  for sharing school material(s) , homework discussions and why not school gossip :D

From then on i started to get a real fascination regarding chat apps , and pretty much any application that would support realtime notifications.

Years after completely abandoning gaming and dabbling for some time in areas such as Industrial Automation , Embedded Devices i rediscovered my passion for chat apps , but this time i wanted to create them.
